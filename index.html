    <p> What started off as a plan to get out of the Bombay bubble turned into the best life experience. 15 year old me discovered the joy of learning, and wanted to chase after this new found passion.
    As I read more, I understood more, and the world began to open up to me. This excitement from learning (not synonymous with studying), was one I hadn't felt before, and I was determined to continue down this path.
    After much research, and self introspection to choose 'this path', I decided studying abroad in the United States was the ideal choice. The combination of a research based insitution, flexibility to
    try out a variety of different subjects, and tempurpedic beds was why I chose WashU. And I never looked back.

      <p><i>"Great people do things before they're ready. They do things before they know they can do it. Doing what you're afraid of, getting out of your comfort zone, taking risks like that--that is what life is. You might find out something about yourself that's really special. If you're not good, who cares? You tried something. Now you know something about yourself." - Amy Poehler</i></p>
